Suggestions for Minor Refactoring:

- Conditional Popup Message: Modify the `chrome.webRequest.onCompleted` listener to send the `updatePopupDomains` message only if the tab (`details.tabId`) where the request completed is also the currently active tab. This would make the message more targeted.
  Example snippet:
  ```coffeescript
  # Inside chrome.storage.local.set callback in onCompleted
  chrome.tabs.query { active: true, currentWindow: true }, (activeTabs) ->
    activeTab = activeTabs[0]
    if activeTab and activeTab.id == tabId
      # Only send if the tab where request completed is the active tab
      chrome.runtime.sendMessage { action: "updatePopupDomains", tabId: tabId, domains: domains }, () ->
        if chrome.runtime.lastError
          null # Expected if popup for this tab isn't open
    # else
    #   console.log "Background: Domain #{domain} added to non-active tab #{tabId}. No popup message sent."
  ```

- API Key Update Trigger for Model Fetching: Implement a mechanism to re-fetch AI models when API keys are updated in the options. This could be done by listening for a specific message from the options script (e.g., `apiKeysUpdated`) or by monitoring `chrome.storage.onChanged` for changes to `geminiApiKey` or `groqApiKey`.
  Example (message listening):
  ```coffeescript
  # Add to chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener
  else if request.action == "apiKeysUpdated"
    console.log "Background: API keys updated, re-fetching models."
    fetchAndStoreModels() # Re-fetch models
    sendResponse { status: "model_refetch_triggered" } # Acknowledge
    true # For async response
  ```

- Abstract Model Fetching Logic: If more AI providers are anticipated, the `fetchGeminiModels` and `fetchGroqModels` functions could be refactored into a more generic function that takes parameters for the API endpoint, headers, and how to extract the model list and model names/IDs from the response. For just two providers, the current approach is manageable.

- Robustness for `activeTab`: In `chrome.tabs.query { active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) ->`, add a check for `tabs && tabs[0]` before trying to use `activeTab = tabs[0]`, to prevent errors if no active tab is found.

Feature Matching (Readme.md):

- Per-Tab Domain Collection: Confirmed. The `onCompleted` listener successfully collects and stores domains per `tabId` in `chrome.storage.local` using the `TAB_DOMAINS_STORAGE_PREFIX`. Deduplication is also handled.
- AI-Powered Descriptions: Partially confirmed. This background script is responsible for fetching the *list of available AI models* from Gemini and Groq if API keys are provided (`fetchAndStoreModels`). It does not directly generate descriptions; that functionality is expected to be handled by the popup script, which would use these fetched models.
- Intuitive Popup Interface: Confirmed from background's perspective. The script provides necessary data to the popup via `getTabDomains` message and handles requests like `clearTabDomains`.
- Configurable Options Page: Confirmed. The background script uses `geminiApiKey` and `groqApiKey` from `chrome.storage.local` (which are set by the options page) to fetch available models.
- Smart API Key Handling: Confirmed. `fetchAndStoreModels` checks for the existence of API keys before attempting to fetch models from the respective services.
- Efficient Caching:
    - Domain Caching: Confirmed. Domains are cached per tab in `chrome.storage.local`.
    - AI Model List Caching: Confirmed. The list of available AI models is fetched and stored in `chrome.storage.local` under `availableModels`.
    - AI Description Caching: This specific feature (caching the actual AI-generated *descriptions* for domains) is not handled by `background.coffee`. It's expected to be a responsibility of the popup script, which would fetch and then cache these descriptions.
- Automatic Cleanup (on tab close): Confirmed. The `chrome.tabs.onRemoved` listener correctly removes domain data for closed tabs.

Discrepancies:
- AI Description Generation & Caching: The `Readme.md` implies these are features of the extension. While `background.coffee` supports this by fetching models, the actual generation of descriptions and their subsequent caching is logically separated and would occur in the popup script. This is a reasonable division of responsibility, not a true discrepancy in overall extension functionality, but worth noting the specific role of `background.coffee`.
